# IntroToMPI

### Exercises for Intro to Parallel Computing with MPI Workshop presented on 4/14/2022

This workshop is offered by the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).
Each exercise is comprised of a serial code (**/serial** folder), the MPI-parallelized version of it (**/solution** folder), and pseudo-code with comments/hints on how to parallelize it (**/hint#** folders). Makefiles are available for compilation with GCC. Exercises are implemented in C++ and Fortran, being identical except for the unavoidable syntax differences. In addition, there is always a **/yourwork** folder that you can use to play with the code and try out your directives. In that folder, you will find the base serial code to each exercise as a starting point (the same found in **/serial**).

## Getting a session on Expanse
During the workshop, you will be editing files, compiling code and, most importantly, **running** things. We don't want to do this in the system's login nodes (the place where you arrive to after logging in through XSEDE's SSO Hub). We want to grab a chunk of a compute node. Follow the steps below.

### Log in
1. Log in to XSEDE's SSO Hub from your local terminal:

    ```
    ssh -l <YourXSEDEUsername> login.xsede.org
    ```
2. Log in to SDSC's Expanse:


    ```
    gsissh expanse
    ```
  
You are now sitting on a login node in Expanse. 
  

### Grab a chunk of a compute node
Copy and paste the following command on your terminal to get 32 cores on a **compute** node, each one running a process:

```
srun --partition=shared --pty --account=nsa108 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=32 --cpus-per-task=1 --mem=60G -t 02:00:00 --wait=0 --export=ALL /bin/bash
```


### Move to the project area and download the exercises source code
In addition to be using a compute node, we will also be using the **project** storage area of Expanse. Besides being the recommended place to always run your applications (**project** has faster access than **home** from the compute nodes), this will also allow members within the same project (all of us here) to read each other's files (not write to them!). Move from your **home** area to the **project** area with the command:

```
cd /expanse/lustre/projects/nsa108/<YourXSEDEUsername>
```

Now simply *git clone* this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/babreu-ncsa/IntroToMPI.git
```

You should be ready to go now! If you know how to get around with *git*, you can alternatively fork this repo and clone it from your account.


## Recommended usage
The main exercise presents an application that performs a Linear Regression through simple grid search. It is intended to be interactive: I really think it is important for you to try to insert your own MPI calls, compile and run the code before looking into the hints, and use the solution as your last resource. The way you approach this is totally flexible and you should do what you feel comfortable with. Below is my recommendation:

1. Take a look at the serial code and make sure you understand what it is doing. I inserted many comments that you may find useful.
2. Try to identify how you are going to perform domain decomposition. What will each process be doing? You may be able to go much beyond what I've done, so don't be shy.
3. Use the **/yourwork** area to write your parallelized version. 
4. Once you are done and are sure your code behaves as expected, check out one possible solution that I implemented in the **/solution** folder. You can also use this a last resource after you exhaust your attempts to parallelize the code.
5. Have a different solution? I want to know about it! Open a GitHub issue here and describe it! I will be happy to add that to this repo.

### yourwork space
If you are working on this from a remote server, I recommend cloning the entire repo and then using the **/yourwork** folders to work on the exercises. You can have that file open in your terminal using a text editor (vi, nano, emacs) and, if you want to check on the hints (or the solution), you can use your browser and look at the files on GitHub, as opposed to have yet another ssh session running (or even worse, having to close and open files every time).

## Compiling MPI code
There are several MPI distributions implemented by open-source communities and vendors. Generally speaking, there shouldn't be much difference between them. If you are really looking to squeezing every single drop of performance out, it may be interesting to try different ones. Here, we eill be using [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) to compile our codes. The MPI-C++ compiler is `mpic++`, and the MPI-Fortran compiler is `mpifort`. On Expanse, to use them, we need to load a few modules:

```
module purge
module load DefaultModules
module load gcc
module load openmpi
```

The compilation itself is exactly the same as if you were using your traditional compiler (e.g. GCC), with no additional flags required. For example, to compile the Hello World code, one possibility is:

```
mpic++ hello_mpi.cpp -o hello_mpi.exe
```

### Makefile
The workspace has a **Makefile** that takes the source code, which is named *ExerciseName_yourwork.<cpp/f90>* and compiles it into an executable *ExerciseName_yourwork.exe* (you will also get an object file that can be ignored). This Makefile already includes the MPI compiler call. However, on Expanse you still need to load the OpenMPI module (see above).


## Running MPI applications
Once the code is compiled, we want to run it in parallel using several processes. To make that happen, we need to use an MPI wrapper that will make the binary generated in the compilation step be replicated to as many processes as we wish. Again, we will be using [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/), and the wrapper is named `mpirun`. For instance, to run the Hello World application with 16 processes, you would do:

```
mpirun -n 16 ./hello_mpi.exe
```

Notice that, again, to use `mpirun` on Expanse, the OpenMPI module needs to be loaded.


## Comments and Hints syntax
Comments that are sprinkled over the code files start with **//** for C++ and **!** for Fortran. Hints start with a **// !! HINT#** and finish with **!!** for C++, start with **! ## HINT#** and finish with **##** for Fortran.
